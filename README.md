The code was written with the guidance of TA Drew's speedrun.

In the first jupyter notebook (part_1_mars_news.ipynb), I wrote a code the extracted the titles and descriptions of recent articles in the Mars news site. I was able to separate each article by its own dictionary so that I could distinguish between individual articles.

The second jupyter notebook (part_2_mars_weather.ipynb) contains information of Mars' temperature during different times, which were also compiled into a pandas database for ease of analysis. 

In parentheses are the questions answered (for example, #1 signifies the findings for question #1)
With 1867 Martian days worth of data (#2), we were able to confirm that there are twelve months in a Martian year (#1).

The bar chart for temperatures for each month showed that month 3 had the coldest minimum temperatures (~-80 degrees Celsius) while month 3 had the warmest minimum temperatures (~-69 degrees Celsius). (#3)

A bar chart for temperatures for each month shows month 6 experiences the least atmospheric pressure (~750 Pascals) while month 9 experiences the most atmospheric pressure (~900 Pascals). (#4)

Knowing that a year on Earth lasts 365 Terrestrial days, I estimated that a Martian year measured in Earth days was about the same between peaks of higher temperatures, much like in the analysis. 
From the two peaks closer to 0 terrestrial days, which reach their highest around 100 days and 750 days respectively, there is a difference of 650 terrestrial days. A Google search lists a Martian year lasting 687 days, which is close to our estimate. (#5)
